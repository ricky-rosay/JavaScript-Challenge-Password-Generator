# <Javascript password generator>

## Description

Password generators are a good application that is needed for those who tend to use the same password for everything. Using the same password for many different apps and websites can allow for someone to have access to your entire life. This password generator will take the thinking away of having to create a new password everytime you sign up for something new. The alert boxes make it really easy to choose the criteria that you want in your password. The first alert box will ask you how many characters, followed by asking the criteria you want in your password. Once the password is created you can then copy and paste it wherever you want.
